# Visual-Agent

This repository contains a Python backend and a React-based frontend for visualizing agent interactions. The project includes test prompts in `Test Prompt.txt` that you can use to test the application's functionality.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muthamizh-TG/Visual-Agent.git
cd Visual-Agent
```

### 2. Set up Python Backend

1. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Set up Frontend (agent-app)

1. Navigate to the agent-app directory:
```bash
cd agent-app
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running locally. You can access the frontend through the URL displayed in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).
